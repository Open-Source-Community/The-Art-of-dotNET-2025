# .NET Summer Training â€“ Incremental Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Welcome to the **.NET Summer Training Project**!  
This project is designed as an **incremental learning experience**, where you will build a full application step-by-step across multiple training sessions.  
Each task you complete will build on the previous one, allowing you to gradually develop your skills and see how small components come together into a larger system.

---

## ðŸ“… Structure
- **Incremental Development**: The project is split into multiple tasks. Each new task extends or improves upon the previous work.  
- **Tasks 1, 2, 3 & 4**:  
- **Final Discussion**: During the last session of the training, we will have a group discussion on the entire project, covering design decisions, implementation details, and lessons learned.
- **Oral Exam**: At the end of the training, each participant will have a short oral exam covering **all sessions**.

## ðŸ“œ Rules & Guidelines
- **AI Tool Usage**:  
  - You may use AI tools **only** for syntax reference (e.g., "What is the syntax for a LINQ query?").  
  - **Do not** use AI to solve tasks or write complete code.  
- **Getting Help**:  
  - Any conceptual or problem-solving questions should be asked on our **Discord server**.  
  - Collaboration is encouraged, but direct code sharing is discouraged unless for debugging help.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
By the end of this training, you will:
- Understand the basics of **.NET** and **C#**.
- Learn how to **design, implement, and extend** an application incrementally.
- Gain experience with **best practices** in software development.
- Improve your ability to **discuss and explain** your code and decisions.

## ðŸ›  How to Approach Each Task
1. **Review** the task description carefully.  
2. **Plan** your approach before coding.  
3. **Implement** the task using your own understanding.  
4. **Test** your work to ensure it functions correctly.  
5. **Document** any design choices or changes you made.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This is a **learning-focused project** â€” the journey matters more than the final product.  
Ask questions, experiment, and make mistakes â€” thatâ€™s how youâ€™ll grow.
